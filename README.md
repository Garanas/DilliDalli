# DilliDalli AI
DilliDalli is a sim mod for the game "Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance", which adds the AI "DilliDalli".

As a project the DilliDalli AI aims to achieve a two things:
1) Provide a more competitive AI experience than the AIs that ship with the game, with initial focus on 1v1 gameplay.
2) Create an improved framework for making AIs compared to the framework that ships with the game.

## Contributing
**TLDR: All contributors welcome!  The only requirements would be basic understanding of the game SCFA, and a willingness to learn some programming (if you don't already know some).**

AI development collaboration mostly occurs in the SCFA AI development discord; for an invite get in touch via either the FAF forums or discord.

For people who either want to contribute or make their own AI, I am happy to help with:
- Environment setup and supporting tools (e.g. automated game running, code profiling).
- DilliDalli AI framework info and help - for the base game framework I can point you to other people with more knowledge.
- Programming + Lua help :)
