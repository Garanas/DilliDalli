Adjacency management
    Identify structures that may be involved in adjacency requirements
    On construction start, register possible adjacent locations (checking for buildable locations)
    Periodically revisit these locations in case of change? (or check on attempting access?)
    Identify overlapping other buildings and flag for possible reclamation
    Provide means to count available adjacencies of any given type
    Provide means to fetch next best location for an adjacency of any given type (subject to safety/bp/component requirements)
    Periodically search all units to add new locations as relevant
Mass Manager
    Identify all options for increasing mass income, and calculate benefits
    Given delegated resources and current tech level / units, select best option for increasing mass
    Manage/Create associated jobs
    Prompt construction of relevant defences
    Provide interface for requesting reclamation of associated units for unit cap reasons
Energy Manager
    Identify all options for increasing energy income, and calculate benefits
    Given delegated resources and current tech level / units, select best option for increasing energy
    Manage/Create associated jobs
    Prompt construction of relevant defences
    Provide interface for requesting reclamation of associated units for unit cap reasons
Buildpower Manager
    Track usage of BP by category
    Identify under-funded jobs
    Identify construction chains leading to new kinds of BP
    Manage construction of new BP where required
    Support component / location restrictions
    Respect production temperature tuning - namely the maximisation of unit production over BP for a provided time period (within the provided budget)
    Determine best kinds of generic mobile BP
    Provide interface for getting the investment cost of higher tech levels of BP
        Monitor and track this for all tech tiers as the game progresses
    Identify and adapt to engiemod and non-engiemod balances
    Provide interface for requesting reclamation of associated units for unit cap reasons
Production Manager
    Land / Navy / Air (inc experimental options for all three) applies to all of the below
    Analyse unit stats to inform unit composition decisions
    Make unit composition decisions based on resources, intel, available BP, and unit stats.
    Manage production jobs (tanks, planes, etc but NOT factories - this is done by BP manager)
    Use estimates from BP manager to make teching decisions, submitting higher tier units as relevant
    Component aware - no use building land or navy on/in the wrong island/pool
    Provide interface for requesting reclamation of associated units for unit cap reasons
Defence Manager
    Similar to production manager, but focussed on structures
    Respond to prompts from various places to make new defensive structures (Shields, TMD, AA, PD, Arty, SMD)
    Manage associated jobs
    Negotiate resources to complete defensive work
    Provide interface for requesting reclamation of associated units for unit cap reasons
Intel
    Monitor own/allied/enemy force disposition across the map (at a per component level)
    Monitor enemy unit composition
    Monitor enemy spending focus (ecoing, land, air, nukes, etc) for predictive responses (not just reactive to completion of those units)
    Estimate enemy economies / track allied economies
    Monitor available reclaim in coordination with Reclaim Manager (i.e. observe enemy going for it)
    Monitor for transportation opportunities and threats
    Direct and control intel assets (namely scout planes)
        Also manage associated jobs
    Identify radar / sonar locations
        Also manage associated jobs
        Manage the turning off / upgrading of these structures (e.g. during power stalls)
    Prompt for defences in specific locations
        e.g. TML spotted, prompt for TMD to defend mexes / bases
             Shields vs Air unit threats
             SMDs vs nukes, etc
    Provide threat estimations to bias jobs to safer locations (upgrade safest mexes first for example)
Unit Control
    Land / Air / Naval / Misc (artillery, TML, Nukes) unit control
    Focuses
        Acquisition / Denial of reclaim resources
        Acquisition / Denial of marker resources (mass points, hydros)
        Protection of own structures, destruction of enemy structures
        Survival of own units, destruction of enemy units
    Be aware of giving away reclaim
    Be aware of map features
    Take into account intel provided information
    Engagement stance to be informed by overall balance of power in game - i.e. more aggressive if holding a greater advantage
Reclaim Manager
    Focus on acquisition of mass by reclaim
    Limited coordination with Mass Manager, more mass always good, but maybe prompt more power in the build up
    Borrow engies where opportunities for reclaim exist
    Consider interactions with ACU (thinking in particular of Setons front spot, or Isis 2v2s)
Map analysis
    Generate useful zones for making unit control decisions
    Identify important land / naval components (mass points / reclaim, or the possibility to bombard mass points / bases)
        Make this dynamic, will change based on opponents actions / investments in bases
    Identify chokepoints
    Identify movement blocking features on the map, even where they don't separate components
    Identify features blocking low firing arcs
        May be fun to try to exploit these
    Provide method for checking required arc to fire between two points
Expansion Manager
    Manage expansion across larger distances, and the setup of remote bases (based on map features)
    Select good locations for new bases / production capacity
        Do this dynamically based on enemy disposition
        Attempt to avoid detection where relevant
        Pay close attention to component changes
    Suppress excess base building on simple maps
    Manage transports - construction and usage
    Reserve engineers for transportation where relevant
    Remove expansions as they are destroyed
Brain / Coordination
    AI specific stuff, not part of framework
    Bias unit composition decisions
    Make production balance decisions, i.e. eco vs land vs air vs navy vs other
    Make use of intel (duh)
Build Order Manager
    Generate prospective build orders based on unit stats (i.e. factory / pgen / mex costs)
    Select build order based on map features (i.e. proximity of mass points, hydro points, type of map, etc)
    Execute build order - manage associated jobs
